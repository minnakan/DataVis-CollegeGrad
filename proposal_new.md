{(justification|}

Data visualization is the best approcah as :

- The data set is too large. College graduate data for the contains entries from 1993 to 2015 with entries being 2 years apart.
- Visualisation can help us understand such enormous ammounts of data easily. Data for graduates has been clasified with enormous detail which can be quite misleading when unless visualised as some indicators are more relevant than others.
- Datavis can help identify hidden trends in employability among college graduates in the US.
